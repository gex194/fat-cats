      "\n" +
      "•  The power of AI has the ability to change the way brands are built, and also perceived, for the better. " +

      "when it was all about fun and connecting with fellow gamers.\n" +

      "whereby the buyer can buy it and add it to their NFT.\n" +

      "In the ‘old times’ artists and inventors were provided support in the form of patronage by the high society to simply exist and create amazing art and incredible inventions—without being forced to monetize it.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Today, artists have to market themselves aggressively, follow trends and bow down to these trends as well as modify their art style in order to ‘make it’, or even just make ends meet.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "A very good example of this sad state of affairs is a successful Korean folk singer auctioning off her award that she just received, on-stage, at the Korean Music Awards in 2017—for just $450.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Fat Cats aim to change this by returning the old concept of patronage, whereby artists will no longer have to market themselves aggressively, and adapt their art style, in order to receive support.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Initially, the art patronage system will be performed manually; first few patroned artists will be selected by the Fat Cats team, and as the community grows, the community will suggest candidates—from which the team will select final recipients of the patronage mechanism.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "In the future it is planned to decentralize the process, however the team will always have a right and ability to veto a patronage, with the purpose of protecting the Fat Cats brand.\n" +

      "\n" +
      "Each Fat Cat will have up to 3 items of various rarity: Legendary, Epic and Rare. These items will provide different interfaces of utilities such as earning larger amounts of in-game resources or gaining a bigger chance to win physical luxury items.\n" +

      "At a later stage of the project, owners of NFTs will be able to extract or add items via our platform, thereby acquiring new utilities or selling a portion of the utilities provided by their Fat Cat. These extractions or additions will be reflected visually. This feature will be powered by our proprietary AI tech. The items will be extracted in an NFT form, hence it will be possible to buy and sell the items on the Fat Cats marketplace or any other Cardano and BNB NFT marketplace.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Ownership of the NFT will not provide commercial rights to the image, however, owners are welcome to use the Fat Cats visuals to create their own designs and memes.
